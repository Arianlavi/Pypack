**PyPack** is a powerful GUI tool for building Python executables using **PyInstaller**, with optional **PyArmor** integration for code obfuscation. It simplifies the process by providing an intuitive interface to select project directories, entry scripts, icons, and additional data files, with support for single-file builds, console/windowed modes, and more.
